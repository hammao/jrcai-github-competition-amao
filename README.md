# XRD Analysis Project

## Overview

At King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), several X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) instruments are available for material characterization and analysis. However, interpreting and visualizing XRD data often becomes challenging due to the variety of file formats, proprietary software limitations, and inconsistent interfaces across different platforms.

To address these challenges, I developed a comprehensive R-based solution for publication-grade XRD data visualization and analysis. This framework evolved from necessity – initially as simple scripts to handle specific files, and eventually into a modular, reusable system.

Over time, as the project grew, several challenges emerged:
- Scattered scripts and files across directories
- Redundant code for importing and processing data
- Inconsistent file paths when sharing with colleagues
- Disorganized outputs making it difficult to track results
- Limited reusability across different research projects

This project represents the culmination of these efforts – a self-contained, portable framework that standardizes XRD analysis workflows. It handles various file formats, provides consistent visualization options, and organizes outputs in a logical structure. Whether you're working with clay minerals, catalysts, or novel materials, this framework streamlines the process from raw data to publication-ready figures.

The solution provides a self-contained, portable structure that can be placed anywhere within a larger project or used as a standalone mini-project, making it ideal for collaborative research environments where different researchers might use different analysis pathways but need consistent, high-quality outputs.
